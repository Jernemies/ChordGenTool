# chord progression tool

Originally an idea I had about a web app to generate random chord progressions. 
Instead I made this iteration on a mobile development course.
Originally it only generated chord progressions, but I added scale generation functionality in a subsequent course.

Plan is to rewrite this in Godot and make this a web app
